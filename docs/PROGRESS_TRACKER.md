## Key Metrics

- **Total Sub-phases**: 12
- **Completed**: 0
- **In Progress**: 0
- **Blocked**: 0
- **Estimated Days**: 10-15
- **Test Files**: 11
- **Current Coverage**: TBD

## Notes for Implementation

1. **ALWAYS** run compatibility test after each sub-phase
2. **NEVER** modify existing method signatures
3. **DEFAULT** to mock mode to preserve demo
4. **TEST** each sub-phase in isolation
5. **DOCUMENT** any deviations from plan

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run specific test
npm test -- mode.test.ts

# Run compatibility check
npm test -- demo.test.ts

# Run all tests
npm test

# Check coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Build SDK
npm run build
```

## Success Indicators

- 🟢 Demo still works
- 🟢 All tests passing
- 🟢 No TypeScript errors
- 🟢 Coverage > 80%
- 🟢 Can connect to test P2P node

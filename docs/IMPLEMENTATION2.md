# Fabstir LLM SDK - Implementation Plan (TDD Approach)

## Overview
Build SDK session support using Test-Driven Development with bounded autonomy. Tests define the interface, implementation follows.

**Repository**: `fabstir-llm-ui/packages/sdk-client` (developed independently)

**TDD Principles**:
- Write ALL tests for a sub-phase first
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Implementation emerges from test requirements
- Keep implementations minimal to pass tests
- No implementation details in this plan

## Test Execution Strategy

### For Each Sub-phase:
```bash
# 1. Write all tests first
npx vitest run [test-file] 
# Expected: All tests fail with "not implemented"

# 2. Show failing output
npx vitest run [test-file] 2>&1 | head -50

# 3. Implement minimal code to pass tests
# Max lines per file enforced

# 4. Verify tests pass
npx vitest run [test-file]
# Expected: All green

# 5. Check implementation size
wc -l [implementation-files]
# Must be within limits

# 6. No console errors (if applicable)
node scripts/testing/console-check.js
```

---

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Requirements
- [ ] Each sub-phase: minimum 80% test coverage
- [ ] Overall SDK: minimum 85% test coverage
- [ ] All edge cases tested
- [ ] All error paths tested

### Performance Benchmarks (via tests)
- [ ] Session creation: < 2 seconds
- [ ] Message send: < 100ms
- [ ] Response streaming: < 50ms latency
- [ ] Host discovery: < 1 second
- [ ] S5 save: < 500ms

### Line Limits (enforced via tests)
- [ ] Simple utilities: 40 lines max
- [ ] Core classes: 60-80 lines max
- [ ] Integration class: 100 lines max
- [ ] Test files: no limit

---

## Boundaries - DO NOT:
- Modify ANY files outside SDK package
- Install dependencies without approval
- Exceed line limits per file
- Write implementation before tests
- Skip test failure verification
- Implement real S5/WebSocket in MVP (use mocks)

---

## Self-Validation After Each Sub-phase:
```bash
# Check test coverage
npx vitest run --coverage

# Check no files modified outside scope
git status --short | grep -v "packages/sdk-client"
# Expected: empty

# Check line counts
find packages/sdk-client/src -name "*.ts" -not -name "*.test.ts" -exec wc -l {} \;

# Run all tests
cd packages/sdk-client && npm test
# Expected: 100% pass
```

This TDD approach ensures the implementation emerges from the tests, keeping the SDK minimal, well-tested, and properly bounded.

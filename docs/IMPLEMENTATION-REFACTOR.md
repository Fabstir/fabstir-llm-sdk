# SDK Browser Compatibility Issues and Fix Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to fix the remaining browser compatibility issues in the @fabstir/sdk-core package that are preventing the harness application from using the SDK. The main issue is that node:assert and other Node.js dependencies are still being included in the browser bundle, causing webpack build failures.

## Current Status

- **Completed**: Phases 1-6 of IMPLEMENTATION5.md
- **Blocker**: node:assert dependency in browser bundle
- **Impact**: Harness pages cannot use SDK, blocking migration

## Goal

Make @fabstir/sdk-core fully browser-compatible so that:
1. Harness pages can import and use the SDK without errors
2. No Node.js dependencies remain in the browser bundle
3. All browser environments are supported (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Phase 1: Identify and Eliminate Node.js Dependencies

### Sub-phase 1.1: Find node:assert Sources
**Goal**: Identify exactly where node:assert is being imported

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Analyze webpack error stack trace to find the importing module
- [ ] Check if any dependencies are using assert internally
- [ ] Scan all sdk-core source files for assert usage
- [ ] Check if build tools are injecting assert for development
- [ ] Identify any other Node.js imports (buffer, crypto, stream)
- [ ] Create list of all Node.js dependencies to remove

### Sub-phase 1.2: Replace or Remove Assertions
**Goal**: Eliminate all assert usage from browser code

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Replace assert with console.assert for development warnings
- [ ] Remove assertions from production builds
- [ ] Create custom assertion utility if needed
- [ ] Update any code that depends on assert behavior
- [ ] Test that removal doesn't break functionality
- [ ] Verify no runtime errors from missing assertions

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues and Solutions:

1. **Hidden Node Dependencies**
   - Solution: Use webpack bundle analyzer to find them
   - Fallback: Create polyfills for essential Node APIs

2. **Breaking Changes**
   - Solution: Test each change incrementally
   - Fallback: Maintain backward compatibility layer

3. **Browser Incompatibilities**
   - Solution: Use standard Web APIs only
   - Fallback: Provide polyfills for older browsers

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Solution: Profile and optimize critical paths
   - Fallback: Implement lazy loading

5. **Wallet Connection Issues**
   - Solution: Test with multiple wallet providers
   - Fallback: Provide manual connection option

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1: 0.5 days (Find and fix node:assert)
- Phase 2: 0.5 days (Fix exports)
- Phase 3: 0.5 days (Rebuild and test)
- Phase 4: 1 day (Complete harness migration)
- Phase 5: 1 day (Browser testing)
- Phase 6: 1 day (Fix remaining issues)
- Phase 7: 0.5 days (Documentation)

**Total: ~5 days**

## Implementation Order

### Critical Path (must be done in order):
1. Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 (Fix SDK)
2. Phase 3 → Phase 4 (Test in harness)
3. Phase 4 → Phase 5 (Browser testing)

### Can Be Parallelized:
- Phase 6 (can start once issues are identified)
- Phase 7.1 (documentation can be written alongside)

---

## Current Status

```yaml
status: Not Started
next_action: Phase 1.1 - Find node:assert sources
blocker: node:assert in browser bundle
priority: Critical
assigned: TBD
```

---

## Notes

- This is a critical blocker for the harness migration
- Focus on minimal changes to get it working first
- Comprehensive refactor can come later if needed
- Test continuously to avoid regressions
- Keep backward compatibility where possible

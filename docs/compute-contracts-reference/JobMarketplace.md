## Current Implementation: JobMarketplaceFABWithS5

**Current Contract Address (Base Sepolia)**: `0xebD3bbc24355d05184C7Af753d9d631E2b3aAF7A` ✅ (Fixed Dec 2, 2024)  
**Previous Address with Payment Bug**: `0x9DE1fCABb9e3E903229B47bA737B23fc473173A1` ⚠️  
**Features**: Session jobs, direct payments, EZKL proof verification, **economic minimums**, **fixed ETH transfers**  
**Documentation**: See [SESSION_JOBS.md](../../SESSION_JOBS.md)

### Recent Fixes (December 2, 2024)
- **Payment Distribution**: Fixed using `call{value:}()` instead of `transfer()`
- **Emergency Withdrawal**: Added `emergencyWithdraw()` for stuck funds recovery
- **Optional HostEarnings**: Works correctly when set to address(0)

### Economic Minimums
- **MIN_DEPOSIT**: 0.0002 ETH (~$0.80) - Prevents spam sessions
- **MIN_PROVEN_TOKENS**: 100 - Ensures meaningful work per proof
- **Token Minimums**: Configurable per token (800000 for USDC = $0.80)

    JobStatus status;         // Current job status
    address assignedHost;     // Assigned host address

    string inputHash;        // Input data hash
    string resultHash;       // Result data hash
}
```

### JobStatus
```solidity
enum JobStatus {
    Posted,    // Job created and funded
    Claimed,   // Job assigned to host
    Completed  // Job finished and paid
}
```

## Core Functions

### postJobWithToken
Posts a new job with USDC payment.

```solidity
function postJobWithToken(
    IJobMarketplace.JobDetails memory details,
    IJobMarketplace.JobRequirements memory requirements,
    address paymentToken,
    uint256 paymentAmount
) external nonReentrant returns (bytes32)
```

**Parameters:**
- `details`: Job execution details (model, prompt, parameters)
- `requirements`: Job requirements (GPU memory, time limit, etc.)
- `paymentToken`: Must be USDC address
- `paymentAmount`: Payment in USDC (6 decimals)

**Requirements:**
- Payment token must be USDC
- Payment amount must be positive
- User must approve USDC transfer
- PaymentEscrow must be configured

**Example:**
```javascript
// Approve USDC
await usdc.approve(marketplace.address, "10000000"); // 10 USDC

// Create job details
const details = {
    modelId: "gpt-4",
    prompt: "Analyze this dataset",
    maxTokens: 1000,
    temperature: 70,
    seed: 42,
    resultFormat: "json"
};

const requirements = {
    minGPUMemory: 16,
    minReputationScore: 0,
    maxTimeToComplete: 3600,
    requiresProof: false
};

// Post job
const jobId = await marketplace.postJobWithToken(
    details,
    requirements,
    USDC_ADDRESS,
    "10000000" // 10 USDC
);
```

### claimJob
Claims an available job (host only).

```solidity
function claimJob(uint256 _jobId) external
```

**Requirements:**
- Job must exist and be in Posted status
- Job must not be expired
- Caller must be registered in NodeRegistryFAB
- Caller must have active status
- Caller must have at least 1000 FAB staked

**Effects:**
- Assigns job to caller
- Changes status to Claimed
- Emits JobClaimed event

### completeJob
Completes a claimed job and triggers payment.

```solidity
function completeJob(
    uint256 _jobId,
    string memory _resultHash,
    bytes memory _proof
) external nonReentrant
```

**Requirements:**
- Caller must be the assigned host
- Job must be in Claimed status
- Must be before deadline
- Result hash must be provided

**Effects:**
- Changes status to Completed
- Credits earnings to host's balance (minus 10% fee)
- Updates reputation if available
- Emits JobCompleted and EarningsCredited events

**Payment Flow:**
1. PaymentEscrowWithEarnings routes payment to HostEarnings
2. 10% fee is deducted (1000 basis points) and sent to TreasuryManager
3. Host's earnings balance credited with 90% of payment
4. Host can withdraw accumulated earnings anytime

### getJob
Retrieves job details.

```solidity
function getJob(uint256 _jobId) external view returns (
    address renter,
    uint256 payment,
    JobStatus status,
    address assignedHost,
    string memory resultHash,
    uint256 deadline
)
```

### setPaymentEscrow
Sets the PaymentEscrow contract (one-time configuration).

```solidity
function setPaymentEscrow(address _paymentEscrow) external
```

**Requirements:**
- Can only be set once
- Must be valid contract address

### setUsdcAddress
Configures USDC token address.

```solidity
function setUsdcAddress(address _usdc) external
```

## Events

```solidity
event JobCreated(uint256 indexed jobId, address indexed renter, string modelId, uint256 maxPrice);
event JobCreatedWithToken(bytes32 indexed jobId, address indexed renter, address paymentToken, uint256 paymentAmount);
event JobClaimed(uint256 indexed jobId, address indexed host);
event JobCompleted(uint256 indexed jobId, string resultHash);
event EarningsCredited(address indexed host, uint256 amount, address token);
```

## Integration Flow

### Complete Job Lifecycle
1. **Host Registration** (in NodeRegistryFAB)
   - Host stakes 1000 FAB tokens
   - Registers with metadata

2. **Job Posting**
   - Renter approves USDC to marketplace
   - Posts job with payment
   - USDC transferred to PaymentEscrow

3. **Job Claiming**
   - Host claims job
   - Marketplace verifies FAB stake
   - Job assigned to host

4. **Job Completion**
   - Host completes work
   - Submits result hash
   - Payment released automatically

5. **Payment Settlement**
   - 90% credited to host's earnings (e.g., 9 USDC from 10 USDC job)
   - 10% platform fee to TreasuryManager

6. **Earnings Withdrawal** (NEW)
   - Host can withdraw accumulated earnings
   - Batch withdrawal saves gas

## Security Considerations

1. **Reentrancy Protection**: Critical functions use `nonReentrant`
2. **Deadline Enforcement**: Jobs expire if not completed on time
3. **Host Verification**: Only FAB-staked hosts can claim jobs
4. **Payment Safety**: USDC held in escrow until completion
5. **One-time Configuration**: Critical addresses can only be set once

## Gas Optimization

- **NEW: Earnings accumulation saves 40-46% gas**
  - Direct transfer: ~115,000 gas per job
  - Accumulation: ~69,000 gas per job
  - Example: 5 jobs save ~220,000 gas total
- Efficient storage packing in Job struct
- Minimal external calls during critical operations
- Batch withdrawal reduces per-job gas cost

## Differences from Original JobMarketplace

| Feature | JobMarketplace | JobMarketplaceFAB |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Host Registry | NodeRegistry (ETH) | NodeRegistryFAB (FAB) |
| Minimum Stake | 100 ETH | 1000 FAB |
| Payment Support | ETH + ERC20 | USDC (configurable) |
| Host Verification | `getNode()` method | `nodes()` mapping |
| Deployment | Single | With dependencies |

## Example Usage

### Complete Flow Example
```javascript
// 1. Setup contracts
const marketplace = await ethers.getContractAt("JobMarketplaceFAB", MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS);
const usdc = await ethers.getContractAt("IERC20", USDC_ADDRESS);

// 2. Post job (as renter)
await usdc.approve(marketplace.address, ethers.parseUnits("10", 6));
const tx = await marketplace.postJobWithToken(
    details,
    requirements,
    USDC_ADDRESS,
    ethers.parseUnits("10", 6)
);
const receipt = await tx.wait();
const jobId = 1; // First job

// 3. Claim job (as host)
await marketplace.claimJob(jobId);

// 4. Complete job (as host)
await marketplace.completeJob(jobId, "QmResultHash...", "0x");
// Earnings are credited, not transferred directly

// 5. Check accumulated earnings
const hostEarnings = await ethers.getContractAt("HostEarnings", HOST_EARNINGS_ADDRESS);
const earnings = await hostEarnings.getBalance(hostAddress, USDC_ADDRESS);
console.log("Host earnings:", earnings); // 9 USDC credited

// 6. Withdraw accumulated earnings (can be done later)
await hostEarnings.withdrawAll(USDC_ADDRESS);
const balance = await usdc.balanceOf(hostAddress);
console.log("Host balance after withdrawal:", balance); // 9 USDC received
```

## Deployment Cost
Total: ~0.006 ETH on Base Sepolia

## Architecture Note

**Hybrid Payment Model**: The JobMarketplaceFABWithS5 contract implements a hybrid architecture:
- **Session Jobs** (new): Use direct, self-contained payments via internal `_sendPayments()` function
- **Legacy Single-Prompt Jobs**: May still reference external PaymentEscrow/HostEarnings contracts
- This design is more gas-efficient for session jobs, reducing external contract calls

## What You Can Do Now

1. **View on BaseScan**: Click the verification links above to see your contracts
2. **Interact with Contracts**: Use BaseScan's "Write Contract" tab
3. **Create a Session Job**: Call `createSessionJob` with ETH or `createSessionJobWithToken` with USDC
   - Payments are handled directly within the contract (no external escrow needed)
4. **Test the System**: Have a host submit proofs, complete sessions, test timeouts
   - Session payments go directly to hosts/treasury without intermediate contracts

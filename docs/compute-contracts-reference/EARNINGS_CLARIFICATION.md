# Important: Use JobMarketplaceFABWithS5, NOT JobMarketplaceLite

## The Confusion

When you asked to deploy the earnings accumulation system, I created JobMarketplaceLite thinking we needed a new contract. This was unnecessary!

## The Reality

**Your existing JobMarketplaceFABWithS5 (`0xD937c594682Fe74E6e3d06239719805C04BE804A`) ALREADY has earnings accumulation built in!**

### Current Working System
- **JobMarketplaceFABWithS5**: `0xD937c594682Fe74E6e3d06239719805C04BE804A` ✅ USE THIS
- **HostEarnings**: `0xcbD91249cC8A7634a88d437Eaa083496C459Ef4E` ✅ ALREADY CONFIGURED
- **Full Features**: S5 CIDs, job requirements, session jobs, USDC support
- **Earnings Accumulation**: Already implemented and working!

### DO NOT USE
- **JobMarketplaceLite**: `0x0b0A6B5908e2c0D3AAD3F3028520d6C9e161c608` ❌ Missing critical features

## How It Works

When a job completes in JobMarketplaceFABWithS5:
1. 90% of payment goes to HostEarnings contract
2. HostEarnings credits the host's balance
3. 10% goes directly to treasury
4. Host can withdraw accumulated earnings anytime

## For Your Client

**No changes needed!** Continue using:
```javascript
const MARKETPLACE = "0xD937c594682Fe74E6e3d06239719805C04BE804A";
const HOST_EARNINGS = "0xcbD91249cC8A7634a88d437Eaa083496C459Ef4E";
```

## Host Withdrawal

Hosts can check and withdraw their accumulated earnings:

```bash
# Check balance
cast call 0xcbD91249cC8A7634a88d437Eaa083496C459Ef4E \
  "getBalance(address,address)(uint256)" \
  $HOST_ADDRESS \
  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000  # For ETH

# Withdraw ETH
cast send 0xcbD91249cC8A7634a88d437Eaa083496C459Ef4E \
  "withdrawEarnings(address)" \
  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \
  --private-key $HOST_PRIVATE_KEY

# Withdraw USDC
cast send 0xcbD91249cC8A7634a88d437Eaa083496C459Ef4E \
  "withdrawEarnings(address)" \
  0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e \
  --private-key $HOST_PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Summary

- The gas-efficient earnings accumulation is ALREADY LIVE in your current deployment
- JobMarketplaceLite was an unnecessary optimization that removes features
- Keep using JobMarketplaceFABWithS5 - it has everything you need

# Current Documentation Status

**Last Updated: January 5, 2025**

This document helps you navigate the Fabstir documentation and identify which files reflect the current architecture vs historical implementations.

## üöÄ Current Architecture

The project now uses **JobMarketplaceFABWithS5** with treasury accumulation AND host earnings accumulation:
- **Treasury Accumulation**: ‚úÖ NEW - Treasury fees accumulate for batch withdrawals
- **USDC Payments**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED WORKING with 90% host / 10% treasury distribution
- **ETH Payments**: ‚úÖ WORKING with dual accumulation (treasury + host)
- **Host Earnings**: ‚úÖ Both ETH and USDC accumulate for batch withdrawals
- **Session Jobs**: Direct, self-contained payments with MIN_DEPOSIT and MIN_PROVEN_TOKENS
- **Gas Savings**: ~80% reduction through dual accumulation (treasury + host)

## ‚úÖ Current Documentation

These documents reflect the current architecture and should be your primary reference:

### Essential Reading
- **[ETH_ACCUMULATION_STATUS.md](./ETH_ACCUMULATION_STATUS.md)** - ETH and USDC earnings accumulation guide
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Current system architecture with session jobs
- **[SESSION_JOBS.md](./SESSION_JOBS.md)** - Comprehensive guide to session-based AI inference
- **[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Latest deployment info with all contract addresses
- **[IMPLEMENTATION2.md](./IMPLEMENTATION2.md)** - Session jobs implementation details
- **[TEST_DEPLOYMENT.md](./TEST_DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Fresh deployment guide

### Code References
- `/src/JobMarketplaceFABWithS5.sol` - Current implementation
- `/src/ProofSystem.sol` - EZKL proof verification
- `/test/JobMarketplace/SessionJobs/` - Session job tests (340+ passing)
- `/script/DeploySessionJobs.s.sol` - Deployment script

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Outdated Documentation

These documents contain historical information or old contract addresses:

### Historical/Legacy
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Contains old contract addresses (JobMarketplaceFABWithEarnings)
- **SUMMARY.md** - Predates session jobs entirely (Aug 7)
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Phase 1-3 is historical, Phase 4-5 differs from actual implementation

### Technical Docs (Partially Outdated)
Many files in `/docs/technical/contracts/` describe the old architecture:
- `HostEarnings.md` - References deprecated contract
- `PaymentEscrow.md` - Describes external escrow (not used for sessions)
- `JobMarketplace.md` - Missing session job functions

## üìö Partially Current Documentation

These documents contain valid concepts but may have outdated examples:

### Conceptually Valid (Check Addresses)
- `/docs/best-practices/` - Principles apply, update contract addresses
- `/docs/guides/` - Concepts valid, verify contract references
- `/docs/examples/` - Patterns useful, update addresses and functions

### Still Accurate
- Gas optimization strategies
- Security best practices
- Node operation basics
- Governance mechanisms

## üîÑ Key Architecture Changes

### Old Model (Pre-Session)
```
User ‚Üí JobMarketplace ‚Üí PaymentEscrow ‚Üí HostEarnings ‚Üí Host
```
- Multiple external contract calls
- Higher gas costs
- Complex error handling

### Current Model (Session Jobs)
```
User ‚Üí JobMarketplaceFABWithS5 ‚Üí Host (direct)
```
- Direct payments via `_sendPayments()`
- 30% gas reduction
- Simplified error recovery

## üìã Migration Notes

If you're migrating from the old architecture:

1. **Contract Updates**
   - Deploy new JobMarketplaceFABWithS5
   - Deploy new ProofSystem
   - No need for separate PaymentEscrow/HostEarnings

2. **Function Changes**
   - Use `createSessionJob()` for continuous AI inference
   - Use `submitProofOfWork()` for checkpoint proofs
   - Payments handled internally, not through escrow

3. **Transaction Model**
   - Session jobs: 5-10 transactions for 50 prompts
   - Old model: 50+ transactions for 50 prompts
   - 85-95% reduction in gas costs

## üéØ Quick Start

For new developers:
1. Read [SESSION_JOBS.md](./SESSION_JOBS.md) first
2. Review [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for system overview
3. Check [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for current addresses
4. Use `/test/JobMarketplace/SessionJobs/` for implementation examples

## ‚ö° Important Notes

- **Session jobs** are the recommended approach for AI inference
- **Direct payments** are more gas-efficient than external escrow
- **Proof checkpoints** replace per-prompt transactions
- **USDC support** is built-in for both ETH and token payments

## üìû Getting Help

If you're unsure about documentation currency:
1. Check the file modification date
2. Look for contract addresses - current ones are listed above
3. Reference the test files for actual implementation
4. When in doubt, use SESSION_JOBS.md as the source of truth

# IMPORTANT: Correct Contracts to Use

## Summary of Today's Confusion

I apologize for the confusion. Here's what happened:
1. You asked for host earnings accumulation for ETH
2. I incorrectly thought we needed a new contract (JobMarketplaceLite)
3. I deployed unnecessary contracts
4. The truth: **Your existing contracts already have everything working!**

## ✅ USE THESE CONTRACTS (Existing, Working)

```javascript
// These are your CURRENT, WORKING contracts with all features
const CORRECT_CONTRACTS = {
  jobMarketplace: '0xD937c594682Fe74E6e3d06239719805C04BE804A',  // JobMarketplaceFABWithS5
  hostEarnings:   '0xcbD91249cC8A7634a88d437Eaa083496C459Ef4E',  // Original HostEarnings
  proofSystem:    '0x2ACcc60893872A499700908889B38C5420CBcFD1',  // Fixed ProofSystem
  nodeRegistry:   '0x87516C13Ea2f99de598665e14cab64E191A0f8c4',  // NodeRegistryFAB
  treasury:       '0xbeaBB2a5AEd358aA0bd442dFFd793411519Bdc11',  // Treasury
  
  // Tokens
  fabToken:       '0xC78949004B4EB6dEf2D66e49Cd81231472612D62',
  usdcToken:      '0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e'
};
```

## ❌ DO NOT USE (Unnecessary Deployments)

```javascript
// I deployed these by mistake - IGNORE THEM
const DO_NOT_USE = {
  jobMarketplaceLite: '0x0b0A6B5908e2c0D3AAD3F3028520d6C9e161c608', // Missing features
  newHostEarnings:    '0x7b66c602bdd2649E65CE1Da8032Ae2835a53bA4c'  // Not configured
};
```

## What's Actually Working

Your **existing** JobMarketplaceFABWithS5 has:
- ✅ S5 CID storage for prompts
- ✅ Job requirements (GPU memory, etc.)
- ✅ Session jobs with proofs
- ✅ USDC payment settlement (90/10 split)
- ✅ ETH payment support
- ✅ **Host earnings accumulation for BOTH ETH and USDC**

The authorization fix I made today (Sept 4) enabled the accumulation feature that was already built in!

## Files I've Cleaned Up

### Removed (unnecessary):
- `src/JobMarketplaceLite.sol` - Not needed
- `script/DeployLite.s.sol` - Not needed
- `client-abis/JobMarketplaceLite-ABI.json` - Not needed
- `client-abis/HostEarnings-ABI.json` - Not needed (use existing)
- `docs/EARNINGS_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Referenced wrong contracts

### Corrected:
- `CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.md` - Now shows correct addresses
- `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Now accurate
- `docs/ETH_ACCUMULATION_STATUS.md` - Correct guide

## Your Test Should Work

Your test `docs/archive/eth-payment-cycle.test.ts` should now work because:
1. The marketplace IS configured with HostEarnings
2. The marketplace IS authorized to credit earnings
3. Both ETH and USDC accumulate in HostEarnings
4. Hosts can withdraw when convenient

## No Client Changes Needed

Your client should continue using the addresses it already has. The earnings accumulation is now active and working.

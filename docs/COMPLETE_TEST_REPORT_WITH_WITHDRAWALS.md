## üéØ Key Achievements

1. **Gasless Operations**: All session operations sponsored by Coinbase
2. **Complete Payment Cycle**: 
   - User paid for inference
   - Host received 90% payment
   - Treasury received 10% fee
3. **Successful Withdrawals**: Both host and treasury withdrew their earnings
4. **Smart Wallet Integration**: Demonstrated with Base Account Kit
5. **S5 Persistence**: Conversations stored and retrievable

## üìã Code Implementation Highlights

### Smart Wallet Authentication
```typescript
const auth = await sdk.authenticateWithSmartWallet(privateKey);
// Creates deterministic smart wallet from EOA
```

### Session Creation (Gasless)
```typescript
const jobId = await marketplace.createSessionJobWithToken(
  hostAddress,
  usdcToken,
  deposit,
  pricePerToken,
  duration,
  proofInterval
);
```

### Withdrawal Code (Self-Contained)
```typescript
// Host withdraws earnings
const hostEarnings = new ethers.Contract(HOST_EARNINGS_ADDRESS, abi, signer);
await hostEarnings.withdrawAll(USDC_TOKEN);

// Treasury withdraws fees
const marketplace = new ethers.Contract(MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS, abi, signer);
await marketplace.withdrawTreasuryTokens(USDC_TOKEN);
```

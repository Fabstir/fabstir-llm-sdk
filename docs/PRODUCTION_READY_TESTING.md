Excellent plan! This comprehensive testing approach will definitely help ensure the SDK is production-ready. Let me analyze
your requirements:

Your Testing Strategy is Sound

Key Strengths of Your Plan:

1. Tests all payment methods (ETH, USDC)
2. Tests both wallet types (MetaMask, Base Account Kit)
3. Uses real test accounts from .env.test
4. Follows the actual user flow (deposit → session → completion → withdrawal)
5. Verifies fee distribution (90% host, 10% treasury)
6. Tests the full cycle including withdrawals

Critical Path:

1. First Priority: Fix node-management-enhanced.tsx


    - Must support multi-chain (Base Sepolia, opBNB)
    - Must support multi-wallet (MetaMask, Base Account Kit)
    - Need to register TEST_HOST_1 and TEST_HOST_2 on the chains
    - Tests need live hosts to connect to

2. Then Create Three Tests:


    - Test 1: ETH payment flow (integration test)
    - Test 2: USDC payment flow (integration test)
    - Test 3: Chat demo harness (UI test)

Key Considerations:

1. Host Selection:


    - Random selection from available hosts is good for testing resilience
    - Need at least 2 test hosts registered

2. Deposit Thresholds:


    - ETH: 0.0005 ETH minimum
    - USDC: $2 minimum
    - Smart to check and top-up only when needed

3. WebSocket Requirements:


    - Real connections to production nodes
    - Must include chain_id in all messages
    - Handle disconnection for settlement

4. Fee Distribution Verification:


    - Check HostEarnings contract for accumulated host fees
    - Check treasury accumulation in JobMarketplace
    - Verify withdrawals work correctly

Potential Issues to Address:

1. Multi-chain considerations:


    - Currently only Base Sepolia has deployed contracts
    - opBNB contracts are placeholders
    - Tests should focus on Base Sepolia for now

2. The VoidSigner issue we fixed:


    - Tests will need proper signers, not VoidSigner
    - Use TEST_USER_1_PRIVATE_KEY for authentication

3. WebSocket session management:


    - Need to ensure proper session initialization with chain_id
    - Handle proof submissions from host
    - Proper completion when user disconnects

Suggested Test Structure:

// Common test flow
async function runFullJobCycle(paymentMethod: 'ETH' | 'USDC', wallet: 'MetaMask' | 'BaseAccount') {
// 1. Setup & authenticate
const sdk = new FabstirSDKCore({...});
await sdk.authenticateWithPrivateKey(TEST_USER_1_PRIVATE_KEY);

    // 2. Check & deposit if needed
    const balance = await sdk.paymentManager.getDepositBalance();
    if (balance < threshold) {
      await sdk.paymentManager.depositNative(amount);
    }

    // 3. Select random host
    const hosts = await sdk.hostManager.listActiveHosts();
    const randomHost = hosts[Math.floor(Math.random() * hosts.length)];

    // 4. Create session from deposit
    const session = await sdk.sessionManager.startSession({
      useDeposit: true,
      host: randomHost.address,
      model: 'llama-3',
      depositAmount: '0.001'
    });

    // 5. Send prompt & get response
    const response = await session.sendPrompt("What is the capital of France?");
    expect(response).toContain("Paris");

    // 6. Complete session
    await session.complete();

    // 7. Verify fee distribution
    const hostEarnings = await getHostEarnings(randomHost.address);
    const treasuryFees = await getTreasuryFees();

    // 8. Withdraw accumulated funds
    await withdrawHostEarnings(randomHost.address);
    await withdrawTreasuryFees();

}

My Recommendation:

Start with updating node-management-enhanced.tsx first as you suggested. This is critical because:

1. You need working hosts for the tests
2. It will validate the multi-chain/multi-wallet setup
3. It's a good way to test the SDK integration before writing tests

Would you like me to help update node-management-enhanced.tsx for multi-chain and multi-wallet support first?

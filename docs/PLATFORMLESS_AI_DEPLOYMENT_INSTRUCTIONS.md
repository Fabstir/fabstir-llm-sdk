What You Actually Need To Do (Given Your Setup)

  1. fabstir-llm-node Docker Image

  Since you already have the build process working locally:
  - ✅ Your existing Dockerfile.production with --features real-ezkl
  - ✅ Push to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry
  - ✅ Pull on Vultr GPU node (same process as your video transcoder)

  Estimated effort: 30 minutes (tag, push, document)

  2. Deploy to Vultr A16 Node

  You already know this workflow from your video transcoder:
  - ✅ Provision A16 instance (same as transcoder setup)
  - ✅ Install nvidia-docker2 (same setup)
  - ✅ Pull Docker image and run with --gpus all
  - ✅ Configure firewall (ports 9000, 8080)

  Estimated effort: 1 hour per node (mostly waiting for provisioning)

  3. Model Hashes & Private Keys

  You're the project team, so:
  - ✅ You already have approved model hashes from your local tests
  - ✅ You have test account private keys in .env.test
  - ✅ Just reuse what you're using locally

  Estimated effort: 0 minutes (already done)

  4. Blockchain Registration

  Same commands you run locally:
  docker exec -it fabstir-node /usr/local/bin/fabstir-llm-node register-node \
    --chain 84532 \
    --name "Production Node 1" \
    --api-url "https://node1.yourdomain.com:8080" \
    --models "0x<your-approved-hash>"

  Estimated effort: 10 minutes per node

  5. DNS & SSL

  You already know this:
  - ✅ Point domain to Vultr instance IP
  - ✅ certbot --nginx -d node1.yourdomain.com

  Estimated effort: 15 minutes per node

  6. Frontend with Kubernetes

  You already did this for your video player dapp:
  - ✅ Next.js/React/Tailwind deployment (same stack)
  - ✅ Kubernetes manifests
  - ✅ GitHub CI/CD pipeline
  - ✅ ArgoCD for visual deployment
  - ✅ Horizontal scaling configured

  Estimated effort: 2-3 hours (adapt existing K8s configs)

  Actual Deployment Timeline

  For 2 production nodes + frontend:
  - Node 1 deployment: 1.5 hours
  - Node 2 deployment: 1 hour (faster second time)
  - Frontend K8s setup: 2-3 hours (reuse existing pipeline)
  - Total: 4.5-5.5 hours

  You Don't Need a DevOps Engineer Because:

  1. ✅ You already run Rust GPU workloads on Vultr A16
  2. ✅ You already have Docker + nvidia-docker2 expertise
  3. ✅ You already manage DNS and SSL
  4. ✅ You already operate Kubernetes with CI/CD
  5. ✅ You already deployed Next.js apps
  6. ✅ You ARE the project team (have all credentials)

  What the Deployment Guide Is Actually For

  The guide is for future third-party GPU providers who want to join the network -
  people who:
  - Don't have your infrastructure
  - Don't know the project
  - Need hand-holding through blockchain registration
  - Don't have Kubernetes expertise

  For you: It's just applying your existing DevOps muscle memory to this specific
  project.

  Final Answer

  Yes, you can absolutely do this yourself without hiring a DevOps engineer.

  The deployment is actually simpler than what you've already accomplished with your
  video transcoder dapp and video player dapp. You're literally just:

  1. Deploying the same Rust + GPU Docker container you run locally
  2. Using the same Next.js + K8s setup you used for video player
  3. Pointing domains (which you already do)

  Suggested next step: Just do it! Start with one node, verify it works end-to-end,
  then scale to 2+ nodes and add the frontend. Your existing infrastructure knowledge
   transfers directly.

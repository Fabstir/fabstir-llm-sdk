# EZKL Implementation Guide - Phase 3.1

## Overview

Implement EZKL (Easy Zero-Knowledge Language) integration for generating zero-knowledge proofs of LLM inference. This allows nodes to prove they performed inference correctly without revealing model weights or intermediate computations.

## Test Files Created

1. **`tests/ezkl/test_integration.rs`** - Tests the overall EZKL integration with the system
2. **`tests/ezkl/test_proof_creation.rs`** - Tests proof generation for inference results
3. **`tests/ezkl/test_batch_proofs.rs`** - Tests batch proof generation for multiple inferences
4. **`tests/ezkl/test_verification.rs`** - Tests proof verification both off-chain and on-chain

## Implementation Structure

Create the following module structure:

```
src/ezkl/
├── mod.rs              - Public API exports
├── integration.rs      - EZKLIntegration struct and setup
├── proof_creation.rs   - ProofGenerator implementation
├── batch_proofs.rs     - BatchProofGenerator for efficient batch processing
└── verification.rs     - ProofVerifier for proof validation
```

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. **EZKLIntegration** (`integration.rs`)

- Initialize EZKL with configuration
- Compile models to arithmetic circuits
- Generate proving/verifying keys
- Cache artifacts for reuse
- Integrate with InferenceEngine

### 2. **ProofGenerator** (`proof_creation.rs`)

- Create proofs for individual inferences
- Support different proof formats (Standard, Compact, Aggregated, Recursive)
- Handle compression levels
- Track performance metrics
- Support incremental proof generation

### 3. **BatchProofGenerator** (`batch_proofs.rs`)

- Process multiple proofs efficiently
- Support different strategies (Sequential, Parallel, Streaming, Adaptive)
- Implement aggregation methods
- Handle partial failures gracefully
- Resource management and limits

### 4. **ProofVerifier** (`verification.rs`)

- Verify proofs with different modes (Full, Fast, Optimistic)
- Support on-chain verification via smart contracts
- Implement caching for repeated verifications
- Handle recursive proofs
- Track verification metrics

## Mock Implementation Strategy

For the initial implementation, use mock backends that simulate EZKL behavior:

1. **Mock Proofs**: Generate deterministic byte arrays based on input
2. **Mock Verification**: Always succeed for valid format, fail for corrupted data
3. **Mock Timing**: Simulate realistic processing times
4. **Mock Resources**: Track memory/CPU usage estimates

## Integration Points

1. **With InferenceEngine**: Add `run_with_proof()` method
2. **With Storage**: Store proof artifacts in S5
3. **With Smart Contracts**: Submit proof hashes on-chain
4. **With Vector DB**: Index proofs for search

## Dependencies to Add

Add to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
# For mock implementation
sha2 = "0.10"
blake3 = "1.5"

# For future real EZKL integration
# ezkl = "x.x.x"  # When switching from mock
```

## Testing Approach

1. Run tests with: `cargo test ezkl::`
2. All 47 tests should pass with the mock implementation
3. Tests are designed to work with both mock and real EZKL
4. Focus on the API contract, not the cryptographic details

## Performance Targets

- Single proof generation: < 1 second (mock)
- Batch proof (10 items): < 5 seconds with parallelism
- Verification: < 100ms per proof
- Memory usage: < 500MB for typical workload

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. Mark Phase 3.1 as complete in IMPLEMENTATION.md
2. Move to Phase 3.2 (Model Management) or another Phase 3 sub-phase
3. In Phase 4, integrate real EZKL library
4. Add GPU acceleration for proof generation

Remember: Follow TDD strictly - tests are already written and failing. Implement only what's needed to make them pass!

# Fabstir LLM Marketplace - Executive Summary

## Vision
**Democratizing AI access through a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace for Large Language Model inference**

## Overview

Fabstir is building the infrastructure for a decentralized AI economy where anyone can monetize their GPU resources by providing LLM inference services, and users can access AI capabilities without relying on centralized providers. Our marketplace creates a trustless, efficient, and censorship-resistant platform for AI services.

## The Problem

### Current AI Market Challenges

1. **Centralization Risks**
   - Single points of failure (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
   - Censorship and content restrictions
   - Data privacy concerns
   - Service availability dependencies

2. **High Barriers to Entry**
   - Expensive API costs for developers
   - Limited access to cutting-edge models
   - Geographic restrictions
   - KYC/compliance requirements

3. **Underutilized Resources**
   - Millions of consumer GPUs sitting idle
   - Data centers with spare capacity
   - No easy way to monetize GPU resources
   - Inefficient resource allocation

4. **Lack of Model Diversity**
   - Limited selection from major providers
   - Difficult to access specialized models
   - No marketplace for custom fine-tuned models
   - Innovation bottlenecked by gatekeepers

## Gas Payment Responsibilities

### Economic Design

The marketplace uses a hybrid gas payment model:

| Operation | Who Pays | Gas Cost | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Session Creation | User | ~200k gas | User initiates service |
| Checkpoint Proofs | Host | ~30k gas each | Host secures payment |
| Session Completion | User | ~100k gas | User triggers settlement |

### Automatic Settlement Innovation

The system now features **gasless session ending for users** through automatic settlement:
- When users end a session, they simply close the WebSocket connection
- The host node (v5+) automatically detects disconnection and calls `completeSessionJob()`
- Hosts pay the gas for settlement (they're incentivized to get their payment)
- Users receive their refund without paying any gas fees
- This eliminates the previous incentive misalignment completely

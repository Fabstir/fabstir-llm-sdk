# Platformless AI - Executive Summary

## Vision

**AI infrastructure where no company sits between you and AI models - trustless, private, and sovereign by design**

## Overview

Platformless AI is building decentralized AI infrastructure that eliminates the platform middleman. Unlike traditional AI services, there's no centralized company that can censor prompts, access your data, or revoke your access. Smart contracts coordinate, P2P connections deliver inference, and cryptographic proofs verify computation - all without requiring trust in a central authority.

Our marketplace connects GPU providers directly with users through blockchain-based settlement, end-to-end encryption, and mathematical proof of computation. This creates a trustless, censorship-resistant, and privacy-preserving platform for AI services.

## The Problem

### Current AI Market Challenges

1. **Platform Control & Censorship**

   - Centralized platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) control access
   - Content filtering based on platform policies
   - Risk of deplatforming or access revocation
   - No recourse if terms change
   - Training on user data without consent

2. **Data Privacy & IP Concerns**

   - Proprietary data sent to third-party servers
   - No end-to-end encryption guarantees
   - IP leakage risk for enterprises
   - Compliance issues (GDPR, HIPAA, financial regulations)
   - Trust-based security (no cryptographic guarantees)

3. **Vendor Lock-In & Economics**

   - 300-750x markup over compute costs
   - Subscription models and rate limits
   - API key dependencies (can be revoked)
   - Limited model selection
   - Geographic restrictions

4. **Enterprise Compliance Gaps**
   - Cannot meet data sovereignty requirements
   - No immutable audit trails
   - Insufficient for ISO 27001, ISO 42001, SOC 2 compliance
   - GDPR/HIPAA violations from third-party data handling
   - Single points of failure

## Our Solution

### Platformless AI: Infrastructure Without the Platform

A decentralized marketplace where smart contracts handle coordination, P2P connections deliver inference, and cryptographic proofs verify computation - no company in the middle.

### Core Architecture

1. **Decentralized Infrastructure**

   - Direct WebSocket connections (user â†” GPU provider)
   - Smart contracts for job assignment (Base L2, opBNB)
   - No central servers or APIs to trust
   - Global distribution with automatic failover
   - Multi-chain support for resilience

2. **End-to-End Encryption (Default)**

   - XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD encryption
   - Forward secrecy via ephemeral session keys
   - ECDSA signatures for sender authentication
   - Zero-knowledge architecture (hosts process encrypted payloads)
   - Only you and the GPU provider hold keys

3. **Cryptographic Verification**

   - STARK proofs via Risc0 zkVM
   - ~221KB proofs generated per 1,000 tokens
   - Off-chain storage on S5 (Sia network)
   - Only 32-byte hash + CID submitted on-chain (737x size reduction)
   - Mathematical certainty of computation

4. **Decentralized Storage**

   - Enhanced S5.js (Sia Foundation grant funded)
   - All conversations encrypted before storage
   - STARK proofs persisted on Sia network
   - No centralized databases or servers
   - Content-addressed, verifiable storage

5. **Multi-Chain Settlement**

   - Base L2 (primary) - fast, cheap transactions
   - opBNB Testnet (secondary) - alternative chain
   - ETH, USDC, FAB token payments
   - Automated escrow and distribution
   - Immutable on-chain audit trails

6. **Developer-Friendly SDK**
   - Browser-compatible (@fabstir/sdk-core)
   - 8 specialized managers (Auth, Payment, Session, Host, Storage, Model, Treasury, Client)
   - Real-time streaming responses
   - Simple integration (5 lines to start)
   - Open source and auditable

7. **Video Transcoding Marketplace** (Post-MVP)
   - Decentralized video/audio format conversion
   - GPU-accelerated transcoding (h264, AV1, AAC, Opus)
   - GOP-based STARK proofs verify quality (PSNR, SSIM metrics)
   - Privacy-preserving (encrypted uploads via S5 + Blake3)
   - Competitive pricing vs. AWS MediaConvert, Mux, Cloudflare Stream
   - Same trustless infrastructure as LLM inference

## How It Works

### For Users (Clients)

1. **Connect Wallet** - Any Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow)
2. **Automatic Encryption** - SDK generates session keys, encrypts all messages
3. **Select Model** - Browse available models and GPU providers
4. **Deposit Funds** - Minimum deposit (e.g., $1 USDC) into smart contract escrow
5. **Send Prompts** - Real-time encrypted inference with streaming responses
6. **Automatic Settlement** - Pay only for tokens used, unused deposit refunded

### For GPU Providers (Hosts)

1. **Register Node** - Specify hardware, stake FAB tokens, list supported models
2. **Set Pricing** - Competitive per-token pricing (marketplace dynamics)
3. **Serve Requests** - Automatic job matching via smart contracts
4. **Process Encrypted Payloads** - Generate inference without seeing prompts
5. **Submit Proofs** - Generate STARK proofs, upload to S5, submit hash on-chain
6. **Earn Revenue** - 90% of payments, 10% treasury fee, instant settlement

### For Video Transcoding (Post-MVP)

1. **Upload Video** - Upload to S5 with Blake3 encryption, get CID
2. **Select Format** - Choose output codec (h264/AV1), resolution (720p/1080p/4K), quality tier
3. **Find Host** - Browse transcode providers by price, supported formats, hardware acceleration
4. **Create Job** - Specify format requirements, deposit USDC based on video duration
5. **Monitor Progress** - Real-time progress updates via WebSocket (GOP-by-GOP)
6. **Verify Quality** - Spot-check random GOPs, validate PSNR/SSIM metrics against spec
7. **Download Output** - Retrieve transcoded video from S5, encrypted with your keys

**Transcode Flow**:
```
Upload to S5 â†’ Create Job â†’ Host Downloads â†’ GPU Transcode â†’ GOP Proofs
â†’ Upload Output to S5 â†’ Submit Proof Hash On-Chain â†’ Payment Release
```

### Technical Flow

```
Client Wallet â†’ Smart Contract â†’ Host Discovery â†’ P2P WebSocket (encrypted)
â†’ Inference (GPU) â†’ STARK Proof â†’ S5 Storage â†’ Hash On-Chain â†’ Payment Release
```

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Blockchain**: Base L2 (Ethereum), opBNB Testnet - low-cost, fast settlement
- **Payments**: ETH, USDC, FAB tokens - multi-token support
- **Encryption**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD, ECDH key exchange, ECDSA signatures
- **Proofs**: Risc0 zkVM STARK proofs - cryptographic verification
- **Storage**: Enhanced S5.js (Sia network) - decentralized, verifiable persistence
- **Networking**: WebSocket P2P - direct client-to-host connections
- **Smart Contracts**: JobMarketplace, NodeRegistry, ProofSystem, HostEarnings, ModelRegistry

### Architecture Highlights

- **Session-Based Model**: Long-running encrypted conversations with checkpoints
- **Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral keys per session, discarded after use
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time token generation with low latency
- **Proof Checkpoints**: Every 1,000 tokens, STARK proof generated and verified
- **Automatic Failover**: Session recovery if host disconnects
- **Multi-Host Isolation**: Each host has unique encryption keys

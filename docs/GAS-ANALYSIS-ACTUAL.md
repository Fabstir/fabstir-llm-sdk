# Actual Gas Analysis

## Key Findings

### Gas Price on Base Sepolia
- **Actual gas price**: 0.001000056 gwei (extremely low!)
- At this rate, a 300,000 gas transaction costs: 300,000 × 0.001 gwei = 0.0000003 ETH

### What Actually Happened

1. **Registration Transaction**: 
   - TX Hash: `0xf75140a18a97df89ac7b50ca9348a8ef8203e08e52716dc7739b212ed0b77c09`
   - Status: Transaction went through but failed (likely reverted)
   - Cost: With manual gas limit of 300,000 × 10 gwei = 0.003 ETH

2. **Approval Transaction**:
   - TX Hash: `0xb63bec36186b7c6523bbc1241965f33d8c62781591f685e89915127a20bbadb0`
   - Status: ✅ SUCCESS (Block 30761877)
   - This worked!

3. **Staking Transaction**:
   - Still failing with "insufficient funds"
   - The error suggests automatic gas estimation is broken

## The Real Problem

The issue is NOT gas prices (they're incredibly low). The problem is:

1. **Registration reverting**: The contract might require the host to already have FAB tokens staked, or have other requirements
2. **Gas estimation failing**: When a contract call will revert, gas estimation often returns absurdly high values
3. **Wrong contract or method signature**: The Node Registry contract might have different requirements

## Actual Gas Costs

With Base Sepolia's current gas price (0.001 gwei):
- Registration: 300,000 gas × 0.001 gwei = 0.0000003 ETH ($0.0012)
- Approval: 50,000 gas × 0.001 gwei = 0.00000005 ETH ($0.0002)
- Staking: 200,000 gas × 0.001 gwei = 0.0000002 ETH ($0.0008)

**Total needed: ~0.0000006 ETH** (less than $0.01!)

Even with our manual override of 10 gwei:
- Each transaction: ~0.003 ETH
- Total for all: ~0.015 ETH ($60)

The account's 0.029 ETH is MORE than enough.

## Solution

The contract is likely reverting because:
1. Node already registered
2. Missing prerequisites
3. Contract paused or not accepting registrations

We need to check the actual revert reason, not the gas estimate.

# Fabstir LLM SDK - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Client SDK for the Fabstir P2P LLM marketplace, enabling applications to connect directly to host nodes without central coordination. The SDK supports two modes:

- **Mock Mode**: For demos and development (current default)
- **Production Mode**: For real P2P connectivity with libp2p

## Development Setup

- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript
- **P2P**: js-libp2p (production mode only)
- **Testing**: Vitest with TDD approach
- **Package Manager**: npm/pnpm
- **Backward Compatibility**: Must maintain exact demo behavior

2. **Run test** - should fail
3. **Implement minimal code** to pass
4. **Refactor** if needed
5. **Run all tests** to ensure no regression

## Success Criteria

### Phase 2 Completion

- [ ] All Phase 2 tests passing
- [ ] Demo works unchanged in mock mode
- [ ] Can connect to real P2P nodes in production
- [ ] Can submit and process real jobs
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] No breaking changes

### Integration Success

- [ ] Works with fabstir-llm-node
- [ ] Integrates with smart contracts
- [ ] Handles network failures gracefully
- [ ] Performance meets requirements

## Current Status

- **Phase 1**: âœ… Complete (Mock implementation working)
- **Phase 2**: ðŸš§ In Progress (Starting with 2.1)
- **Phase 3**: ðŸ“‹ Planned

## Implementation Order

For Phase 2, implement sub-phases in order:

1. Start with 2.1 (Mode Configuration)
2. Ensure 2.1 tests pass completely
3. Move to 2.2, and so on
4. Don't skip ahead - each phase builds on previous

## Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: The demo must continue working exactly as is
- **Incremental Changes**: Each sub-phase should be small and focused
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 100% coverage of new code
- **Documentation**: Update docs as features are added
